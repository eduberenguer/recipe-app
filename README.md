## Architecture

Most of the app follows a straightforward layered structure (Component → Hook → API route → Server function → PocketBase). For the **AI recipe generation feature**, a Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters) was introduced on purpose, since this is the part of the app most likely to change providers (e.g. swapping OpenAI for another model, or PocketBase for another database) and the one that benefits the most from being testable in isolation.

```
core/
  domain/generatedRecipe.ts        → domain type (GeneratedRecipe)
  ports/AIRecipeAssistant.ts       → contract: generateRecipe(userMessage)
  ports/RecipeSearcher.ts          → contract: searchByIngredients(ingredients)
adapters/
  ai/OpenAIRecipeAssistant.ts      → implements AIRecipeAssistant using OpenAI's
                                      function/tool-calling
  persistence/PocketBaseRecipeSearcher.ts → implements RecipeSearcher using PocketBase
app/api/userInteractions/aiChat/route.ts  → driving adapter (composition root):
                                             wires the concrete adapters and calls
                                             the ports, with no knowledge of OpenAI
                                             or PocketBase internals
```

- The **Core** (`core/`) only defines contracts (ports) and domain types. It has zero dependencies on Next.js, OpenAI or PocketBase.
- The **adapters** (`adapters/`) implement those contracts for a specific technology. `OpenAIRecipeAssistant` depends only on the `RecipeSearcher` port, never on `PocketBaseRecipeSearcher` directly — so the database engine or the AI provider could be swapped by changing a couple of lines in `route.ts`, without touching any business logic.
- This pattern was applied selectively to this feature, not the whole codebase — the rest of the app didn't need this level of isolation.

## Upcoming Features
